= Environment clean up and troubleshooting

== Clean up

In order to start the demo from scratch, with minimal effort: delete only the kafka broker and the topics:

[source,shell]
----
oc delete kafkatopics --selector="strimzi.io/cluster=my-cluster"
oc delete kafka my-cluster
----

Drop the PVC:

[source,shell]
----
oc delete pvc --selector="strimzi.io/cluster=my-cluster"
----

Delete kafka rebalance:

[source,shell]
----
oc delete kafkarebalance full-rebalance
----

Then, you can apply again the first two yaml files.

=== Database clean up

[source,shell]
----
oc rsh event-db-<id>
$ psql -U quarkus quarkus
quarkus=> DELETE FROM event;
quarkus=> ALTER SEQUENCE event_seq RESTART WITH 1;
----

== Troubleshooting

When on the client side you get an error id, e.g.:

```
2023-06-06 17:50:29,556 DEBUG Runtime failure during token validation (ErrId: 5cbf1e54)
```

You can search that id in the server log to gather further insights.

To raise the log verbosity, use the following configuration:

```yaml
spec:
  kafka:
    logging:
      type: inline
      loggers:
        log4j.logger.io.strimzi: "DEBUG"
```
