= Keycloak integration

WARNING: In this document, *Keycloak* and *Red Hat SSO* are interchangeable. The latter is the product made out of the upstream community project known as Keycloak. However, all the procedures are tested using *Red Hat SSO*.

TIP: This document was initially developed targeting fish shell, but it strives to provide also the bash alternatives. Here is a general rule, that will not be advertised further: the command `set -x ENV_VAR xxx` must be replaces with `export ENV_VAR=xxx`

== Prerequisites

This document expects:

* AMQ Streams operator deployed
* A Kafka cluster already deployed in your environment called `my-cluster`.
* No authorization configured

== Deploy and configure Keycloak

Create keycloak in its own namespace:

[source,shell]
----
oc new-project keycloak
oc apply -f k8s/keycloak/01-rhsso-operator-olm.yaml
oc apply -f k8s/keycloak/02-keycloak.yaml
----

Show the keycloak user and password:

[source,shell]
----
oc get secret credential-my-keycloak -o jsonpath='{.data.ADMIN_USERNAME}' |base64 -d
oc get secret credential-my-keycloak -o jsonpath='{.data.ADMIN_PASSWORD}' |base64 -d
----

Show the essential information about keycloak:

[source,shell]
----
oc describe keycloak my-keycloak
----

Create the `kafka` realm:

[source,shell]
----
oc apply -f k8s/keycloak/03-kafka-realm.yaml
----

A **client** is an application or service that interacts with Keycloak for authentication and authorization purposes

Clients can be of different types, including web applications, mobile applications, single-page applications (SPAs), and service accounts. Each client in Keycloak is assigned a unique client ID and can have its own set of configuration settings, security protocols, and access permissions.

We need 2 clients one for the consumer application and anouther for the producer one:

* client-id `kafka-consumer`
* client-id `kafka-producer`

They have to be configured: `confidential` and `service account enabled`.

In order to have predictable secrets and streamline the remaining part of the configuration, import a realm base configuration:

. Select the Kafka realm
. From the side menu select *Import*
. Upload the json file available in this repository: `docs/realm-no-pol.json`
. At question *If a resource exists* choose `Overwrite`

in addition to the two clients, the import prepares some definitions that will be useful later:

* `kafka-authz` client which hold the authorization configuration
* Realm roles: `topic-consumer` and `topic-producer`

== Kafka authentication

The following picture shows the authentication flow when the set up is completed:

image:images/keycloak-kafka-authentication.png[]

Switch on the kafka project and keep the Keycloak endpoint in a convenient environment variable:

[source,shell]
----
oc project my-kafka
set -x KEYCLOAK_ROUTE (oc get route keycloak -n keycloak -o jsonpath='{.spec.host}')
----

The following command adds a new Kafka listener that allows access to applications that bring the JWT token issued by keycloak:

[source,shell]
----
oc patch kafka/my-cluster --type=merge --patch-file=(cat k8s/keycloak/05-kafka-listener.yaml.patch | envsubst | psub)
----

TIP: Bash alternative: `oc patch kafka/my-cluster --type=merge -p "$(cat k8s/keycloak/05-kafka-listener.yaml.patch | envsubst)"`

This is the listener configuration:

[source,yaml]
----
spec:
  kafka:
    listeners:
      - name: external
        port: 9094
        type: route
        tls: true
        authentication:
          type: oauth 
          validIssuerUri: https://${KEYCLOAK_ROUTE}/auth/realms/kafka
          jwksEndpointUri: https://${KEYCLOAK_ROUTE}/auth/realms/kafka/protocol/openid-connect/certs
          checkIssuer: true
          checkAccessTokenType: true
          accessTokenIsJwt: true
          enableOauthBearer: true
          maxSecondsWithoutReauthentication: 3600 
----

== Client side configuration

In this section, you will configure the *kafka consumer* in your local environment to connect to the remote Kafka server using the OAuth authentication mechanism:

The client application needs to enstablish 2 TLS connections: one to Keycloak and one to Kafka.
In this example, the Kafka endpoints uses a self signed CA, so we create a truststores to support it:

[source,shell]
----
oc get kafka my-cluster -o=jsonpath='{.status.listeners[?(@.name=="external")].certificates[0]}{"\n"}' > kafka-cluster-ca.crt
keytool -import -trustcacerts -alias root -file kafka-cluster-ca.crt -keystore truststore.jks -storepass password -noprompt
----

Add application properties to enable the OAUTHBEARER authentication:

[source,shell]
----
set -x KAFKA_ROUTE (oc get kafka my-cluster -o jsonpath='{.status.listeners[?(@.name=="external")].bootstrapServers}')
echo | cat - k8s/keycloak/06-application.properties | envsubst >> kafka-consumer/src/main/resources/application.properties
----

Update the password in `application.properties` to match the secret in the Keycloak web console.

Make sure that OAuth dependecy is present in `pom.xml`

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>io.strimzi</groupId>
  <artifactId>kafka-oauth-client</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

Run the kafka consumer:

[source,shell]
----
mvn -f kafka-consumer/pom.xml clean quarkus:dev
----

The following command adds the OAuth configuration to the producer using the respective `kafka-producer` user.

[source,shell]
----
echo | cat - k8s/keycloak/06-application.properties | envsubst | sed 's/consumer/producer/g' >> kafka-producer/src/main/resources/application.properties
----

Run the producer to check it's working as expected:

[source,shell]
----
mvn -f kafka-producer/pom.xml clean quarkus:dev
----

== Enable OAuth for client applications in OpenShift

Once the authorization is enabled at Kafka level, client applications cannot access to Kafka in an anonymous way, even if the connection comes from an internal listener. For such a reason, make sure that authentication is enabled on all your listeners.

The following script show the environment variable to enable client OAuth authentication:

[source,shell]
----
cat k8s/keycloak/09-configmap.template | envsubst
----

Add the outcome of the previous command to the consumer _configmap_:

[source,shell]
----
oc edit configmap kafka-consumer-config
----

Repeat the configuration for the producer using the following variables:

[source,shell]
----
cat k8s/keycloak/09-configmap.template | envsubst | sed 's/consumer/producer/g'
----

Add the outcome of the previous command to the consumer _configmap_:

[source,shell]
----
oc edit configmap kafka-producer-config
----

== Kafka Authorization

In this section, it will be enabled the Kafka authorization and the SSO will be used to retrieve the permission. The following picture shows the interactions between the parties:

image:images/keycloak-kafka-authz.png[]

=== Kafka Authorization model

Kafka operation: `Read`, `Write`, `Create`, `Delete`, `Alter`, `Describe`, `ClusterAction`, `DescribeConfigs`, `AlterConfigs`, `IdempotentWrite`, `CreateTokens`, `DescribeTokens`, `All`

Kafka resources:

* `Topic`
* `Group` represents the consumer groups in the brokers
* `TransactionalId` represents actions related to transactions
* `DelegationToken` represents the delegation tokens in the cluster
* `User`: CreateToken and DescribeToken operations can be granted to User resources to allow creating and describing tokens for other users

An API key (protocol) is represented by a specific request and response pair. Some of the commonly used operations include:

* `Produce`: The produce operation allows clients to send messages to Kafka brokers for storage and distribution. Clients send a produce request containing the messages they want to publish, and brokers respond with a produce response indicating the success or failure of the operation.
* `Fetch`: The fetch operation allows clients to retrieve messages from Kafka brokers. Clients send a fetch request specifying the topic, partition, and offset they want to read from, and brokers respond with a fetch response containing the requested messages.
* `Metadata`: The metadata operation retrieves metadata about topics, partitions, and brokers in the Kafka cluster. Clients can send a metadata request to obtain information such as the list of available topics, partition leaders, and replicas.
* `Offset Commit`: The offset commit operation is used by consumer clients to inform Kafka brokers about the progress of consuming messages. Clients send an offset commit request to commit the offsets of consumed messages, and brokers respond with an offset commit response.

Privileges can apply to specific tuples of protocol, operation and resources, e.g.:

[options="header"]
|===========================================================================================================================================
| PROTOCOL      | OPERATION       | RESOURCES        | NOTE 
| PRODUCE       |	Write	          | TransactionalId  | An transactional producer which has its transactional.id set requires this privilege 
| PRODUCE       |	IdempotentWrite	| Cluster	         | An idempotent produce action requires this privilege
| PRODUCE       |	Write	          | Topic	           | This applies to a normal produce action
| FETCH         |	Read            | Topic            | Regular Kafka consumers need READ permission on each partition they are fetching
| OFFSET_COMMIT | Read            | Group            | An offset can only be committed if it's authorized to the given group and the topic too
| OFFSET_COMMIT |	Read            | Topic	           | Since offset commit is part of the consuming process, it needs privileges for the read action
|===========================================================================================================================================

=== Keycloak concepts

*Clients* are entities that interact with Keycloak to authenticate users and obtain tokens. Most often, clients are applications and services acting on behalf of users that provide a single sign-on experience to their users and access other services using the tokens issued by the server

*Permissions* are the individual actions or operations that a user or client can perform on a specific resource. For example, permissions can include actions like "read," "write," "create," or "delete" on a particular *resource*.

*Policies* are the rules or conditions that determine whether a user or client is granted or denied access to perform those permissions on a resource. Policies evaluate the permissions requested by a user or client and make access control decisions accordingly.

A *Role* is a set of permissions or access rights that can be assigned to users or clients. 

A *permission* associates the *object* being protected with the *policies* that must be evaluated to determine whether access is granted.

X CAN DO Y ON RESOURCE Z

where:

* X represents one or more users, roles, or groups, or a combination of them. You can also use claims and context here.
* Y represents an action to be performed, for example, write, view, and so on.
* Z represents a protected resource, for example: a topic, a consumer group.

*Scope-based Permission*: use it where a set of one or more client scopes is permitted to access an object.

*Resource-based Permission* defines a set of one or more resources to protect using a set of one or more authorization policies.

An *Authorization Service* is a component of an identity and access management (IAM) system that handles the process of granting or denying access to protected resources based on predefined policies and rules. Any *confidential client* can provide the authorization service.

=== Mapping Kafka Authorization in Keycloak

This section shows how to create a client with the authorization services enabled, then inside the client configuration how to define:

* roles
* resources
* permissions

Open the browser with the keycloak route URL.

See in section <<Kafka authentication>> how to retrieve the Keycloak administration user and password.

After the login, select the `Kafka` Realm.

IMPORTANT: If the import procedure worked without issues you can *jump* on <<Create Permissions>> section.

Create the client to host the kafka authorization service:

[source,shell]
----
oc apply -n keycloak -f k8s/keycloak/07-authz-client.yaml
----

Alternatively, via web console:

. Create `kafka-authz` client
. Set *Access Type* to `confidential`
. Switch on `Service Account Enabled`
. Switch on `Authorization Enabled`
. Save

==== Create and assign Roles

From the left menu select *Roles* and add 2 roles: `topic-consumer` and `topic-producer`.

Select the *Clients* entry from left menu:

. Select `kafka-consumer`
. Switch to the *Service Account Roles* tab
. Assign `topic-consumer` role

Repeat the previous steps for `kafka-producer` and `topic-producer`.

==== Decision Strategy

Affirmative decision strategy means that at least one permission must be evaluated positive.

Select the *Clients* entry from left menu and open the `kafka-authz` client.

. Switch to the *Authorization* tab
. In the nested tabs line, select *Settings*
. Set *Decision Strategy* to `Affirmative`
. Save

==== Create Authorization Scopes

Select the *Clients* entry from left menu and open the `kafka-authz` client.

. Switch to the *Authorization* tab
. In the nested tabs line, select *Authorization Scopes*
. Create the following scopes: `Read`, `Write`, `Describe`, `IdempotentWrite`

==== Create Resources 

In *Authorization* > *Resources*

. Delete the Default Resource
. Create the following resources: 
.. `Topic:event` and add all the available scopes
.. `Cluster:*` and add `IdempotentWrite` as scope

==== Create Permissions

Prerequisites:

* Roles are defined (at realm level)
* Resources are defined (at client level)
* Authorization Scopes are defined (at client level)

Grant permissions to _consume_ from a topic (Scope-based Permission):

. Navigate in `kafka-authz` client, then *Authorization* tab
. In the second level of tabs select *Permission*

.. Delete `Default Permission` if it exists

. From *Create Permission* drop down list select *Scope-Base*

.. Enter a meaningful *name*: `Topic consumers can read and describe topic:event`
.. In the *Resource* field select `Topic:event`
.. In the *Scope* field enter: `Read`, `Describe`
.. Create a new *Policy* select _Role Policy_

... Enter a meaningful *name*: `topic consumer policy`
... In *Realm Roles* select and add `topic-consumer`
... Save

.. Save

Grant permissions to any _consumer group_ (Resource-based Permission):

. Enter a meaningful _name_: `Topic consumers can use any consumer group`
. In the _Resources_ field select `Group:*`
. Select an existing policy e.g. `topic consumer` or create a new one


Grant permissions to _produce_ into a topic (Scope-based Permission):

. Enter a meaningful *name*: `Topic producer can write and describe topic:event`
. In the *Resource* field select `Topic:event`
. In the *Scope* field enter: `Write`, `Describe`
. Create a new *Policy* select _Role Policy_
.. Enter a meaningful *name*: `topic producer policy`
.. In *Realm Roles* select and add `topic-producer`
.. Save

. Save

Grant _IdempotentWrite_ permissions at Cluster level (Scope-based Permission):

. Enter a meaningful *name*: `Topic producer have IdempotentWrite grant at Cluster level`
. In the *Resource* field select `Cluster:*`
. In the *Scope* field enter: `IdempotentWrite`
. Add `topic producer policy`
. Save

=== Configure Kafka Authorization

The following command will set up Kafka to delegate the authorization to Keycloak

[source,shell]
----
oc patch kafka/my-cluster --type=merge --patch-file=(cat k8s/keycloak/08-kafka-authorization.yaml.patch | envsubst | psub)
----

TIP: Bash alternative: `oc patch kafka/my-cluster --type=merge -p "$(cat k8s/keycloak/07-kafka-authorization.yaml.patch | envsubst)"`

If the Keycloak definitions are correct, you can execute the local consumer and producer and check the normal message flow.

If you get an authorization exception on the client side, you can enable the logging in Kafka to investigate the OAuth behavior.

See xref:../docs/keycloak-integration-appx.adoc#Troubleshooting[Troubleshooting].

== Further Information

For more information and troubleshooting tips, see the
xref:../docs/keycloak-integration-appx.adoc[Appendix].

== Clean up

Remove authentication and authorization from the cluster definition or replace the entire configuration with the original.

Reset application configuration:

[source,shell]
----
oc replace -f kafka-consumer/src/main/kubernetes/openshift.yml
oc replace -f kafka-producer/src/main/kubernetes/openshift.yml
----
